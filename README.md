# Lidar-Scanner

Start of the project is a result of my increasing interest in dynamic systems and autonomous vehicles.
I will regularly update it with new things i learned during the process.
UART may be not the best protocole to be used, but it already gave me some promising data output, where I was
collecting rotation angle and measured distance and could graph cross-section of the room i was working in.
