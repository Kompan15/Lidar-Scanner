# Lidar-Scanner

Start of the project is a result of my increasing interest in dynamic systems and autonomous vehicles.
I will regularly update it with new things i learned during the process.
UART may be not the best protocole to be used, but it already gave me some promising data output, where I was
collecting rotation angle and measured distance and could graph cross-section of the room i was working in.

I am working on raspberry, and the fun thing is that you can connect to it over Remote Desktop Connection which means you don't 
need to have separate screen to see its desktop.
